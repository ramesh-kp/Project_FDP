## Initial Thoughts on OTA Updates

For the firmware upgrade, wait for user input.
Go to the link and download the new firmware if the user agrees to the firmware upgrade.
It is necessary to unzip the firmware file.
To determine whether there are any differences between the new firmware and the previous version, compare the two. (This is optional.)
Remove the old firmware from the destination and replace it with the new firmware you have downloaded.
The firmware will be updated as a result of the voice output.
Close the current terminal and open a new one.
In the new terminal, run the main python script.
The firmware update is informed by the voice output.
Make sure that all of the features are working properly.
