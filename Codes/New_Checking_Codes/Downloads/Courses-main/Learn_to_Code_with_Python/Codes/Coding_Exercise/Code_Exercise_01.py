1.	1.	Use the print function to output the text "I am a developer!".
		Remember -- case sensitivity matters in Python. 
		All characters and casings must match the the ones in the string above.
	2.	Use the print function to output the string "a ** b ** c". 
		Make sure to use the proper keyword argument to separate the values. 
		Don't cheat by manually copying and pasting the string.
	3.	Help me out! When I print the two lines below, they are separated by a line break. 
		What's peanut butter without jelly? NOTHING! 
		Fix the code to ensure the second line picks up where the first line concludes. 
		Your solution should have 2 print function calls.
		EXAMPLES
		--------
		print("Peanut butter and ")
		print("jelly")
